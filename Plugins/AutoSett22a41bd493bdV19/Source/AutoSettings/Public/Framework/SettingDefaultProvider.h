/**
 * Base class for providing dynamic default values for settings.
 * 
 * Default providers are executed during AutoSettings initialization to determine appropriate
 * default values based on hardware, user preferences, or custom logic.
 * 
 * Providers can be implemented in both C++ and Blueprint, and are configured on individual
 * SettingType assets. Multiple providers can exist per SettingType and are executed in the
 * order they appear in the DefaultProviders array.
 * 
 * Providers return key fragments that are appended to their parent SettingType's base key.
 * If a generated setting doesn't exist, it will be automatically registered using the parent SettingType.
